# PolVolSec Tips

This page is an assembly of tips for political volunteers and campaigns to encourage good digital security procedures. 

The underlying resource is https://github.com/nickdimwill/nickdimwill.github.io/blob/master/advice.yaml which are all of the tips in YAML format with metadata for domain, intended audience, skill level, etc.

Most or all of these pieces of advice can be found elsewhere, but always said slightly differently. I want this to be a collaborative effort to create an open dataset of clear, actionable tips for political volunteers and campaigns.
