    <h2> <center> <i>Security tips for political volunteers and campaigns</i> </center></h2>


<br>

<h3>Basic</h3>

   - Use a password on all computers. <br>

   - Enable lock screen on phone. <br>

   - Do not repeat passwords across any accounts. <br>

   - Use two-factor authentication on all available accounts. <br>

   - Run software and OS updates. Security flaws are discovered and fixed all the time. <br>

   - Do not use the same password on different accounts. <br>

   - A good password is long, like the series of words "correct horse battery staple". <br>

   - Do not click suspicious links or attachments in emails. Practice skepticism. <br>

   - Do not share passwords. <br>

   - Do not write passwords down on a sticky note attached to your monitor. <br>


<h3>Intermediate</h3>

- Use a password manager such as 1Password to make it easier to use the strongest passwords. <br>

- On your mac, turn on full-disk encryption. <br>

- Use Firefox for your internet browser. <br>

- Plain text messaging is not encrypted. Better is a phone call, video chat, Signal, Telegram. <br>


<h3>Advanced</h3>

- Use a physical 2FA key. <br>

- Install uBlock Origin and HTTPS Everywhere extensions for browser. Avoid installing any other extensions. <br>

- Use widely-used open-source software where possible. More eyes on the source code means more vulnerabilities fixed. <br>

- Don't allow 3rd-party apps to have access to your email. <br>

- Look at what 3rd-part apps you have installed on your phone. Watch what permissions they ask for at installation. <br>


<h3>Campaign-specific</h3>

- Designate a campaign team member to have a digital security role. <br>

- Have a digital security handout for campaign volunteers to follow. <br>

- Treat private social media communication as if it were public. <br>

- Use a dedicated email address for political work vs personal life. <br>

- Share documents in Google Drive, not as email attachments. <br>
